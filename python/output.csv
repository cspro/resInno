Many of the Common Core math standards that emphasize independent thinking, sense making and abstract reasoning are also heavily influenced by the principle of productive struggle, underscoring the importance that both parents and teachers are comfortable promoting productive struggle in math learning. Unfortunately, the little work that has been done on productive struggle suggests it is quite difficult for educators to adopt this approach. For instance, the TIMMS studies showed that every one of 83 U.S. math classroom videos, teachers converted challenging problems into procedural tasks. The same challenge applies to parents and schools' efforts to educate parents, who play a significant role in monitoring childrenâs independent work and shaping attitudes toward challenging learning situations. Recent studies show that well-intentioned parents who are actively involved in supporting math homework can significantly hinder productive struggle. 
","The purpose of the study is to investigate the struggle efficacy beliefs and student-struggle intervention behaviors of elementary school parents as they support student learning of mathematics. Specific goals include:
(2015) Document parentsâ struggle efficacy beliefs and self-reported homework intervention behaviors. Analyze any potential relationship with parentsâ self-reported levels of math anxiety.
(2016) Study the effects of observed parent homework helping behaviors on math performance as a function of their math anxiety and struggle efficacy beliefs.

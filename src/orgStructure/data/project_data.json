Results suggest academic achievement is important to college readiness, but motivation and behavior are critical as well.

Each category has a conceptual definition, which makes these college readiness levels more interpretable for end users than raw index values. </li><li>The next step is to apply this analysis and standard-setting process to district-level data for district partners.</li></ol>"

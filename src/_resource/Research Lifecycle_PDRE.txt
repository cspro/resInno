How Research Supports the Product Lifecycle
The Center for Product Design Research & Efficacy equips teams across the globe with research to create and continuously improve industry-leading programs that have a measurable impact on someone's life through learning.

Product Market Research
Research that gathers, analyzes and interprets information about a target market, including customer needs, preferences and the competitive landscape, in order to inform product development and business strategy.

Efficacy Research
Research that examines the impact of a product on outcomes such as student achievement via the use of an experimental or quasi-experimental study.
Product Design Research

Research that uses investigative techniques to support the strategic design and development of products, services, and programs
Learner Outcomes
Research
Special Populations Research
Data Partnerships
User Testing
Participatory Design
Instructional Tryouts

Market Needs Assessment
Product Concept and Prototype Testing
Pricing, Packaging, and Messaging Research
Product Lifecycle Stages

Title: How Research Supports the Product Lifecycle
Description: 2-3 sentences that describe the Center for Product Design Research & Efficacy


Graphic: Product Lifecycle Stages (need to redo graphic to match style--maybe use photos and look like the wheel) (but this is not a navigation element).

Research Buckets: Spanning stages of the product lifecycle are three research buckets (Efficacy Research; Product Design Research; Product Market Research). These each have a description. We can include 2-3 sentence description on this page; or do a pop-up. I imagine these looking like the horizontal “lines of business” elements on the tool (Higher Ed; Professional; K12)

Research Sub-Types: Within each of the three buckets are 3 associated research types. These are clickable, and provide a pop-up describe (see content in slides). These should be gray with rounded edges (kind of like the gray boxes in the current tool).




Learner Outcomes Research


Project Leads:  
Marcy Baughman, Mary Ehmann, Ann Vilcheck

Project Goals:
To evaluate the impact of program and/or solution offerings on learner outcomes through the use of studies using scientific research designs.

Project Results:
Studies provide evidence of program/offering impact and qualitative data on implementation practices and teacher/student feedback.

Special Populations Research


Project Leads:  
Marcy Baughman and Mary Ehmann

Project Goals:
Evaluate the impact of a program or offering on specific populations such as English Language Learner (ELL) students or students in a country that wasn’t intended to be the primary customer.

Project Results:
Studies provide evidence of program or offering impact for these populations of learners.

Data Partnerships


Project Leads:  
Marcy Baughman and Mary Ehmann

Project Goals:
Examine impact of Pearson program or offering in partnership with a school or district.

Project Results:
Study outcomes provide evidence of program or offering impact via data from local assessments and/or instruments that are of high interest and value to the customer.

User Testing


Project Lead: Rusty Brandt, Lisa Maurer

Project Goals:
Work with product teams to develop and implement studies that integrate the voice of the user throughout the research lifecycle. 

Project Results
By focusing on user research, we are able to collect evidence of the utility, efficiency and engagement of our solutions.

Participatory Design


Project Lead: Robin Duffy, Lisa Maurer


Project Goals: Connect product teams to the ultimate end users of a program and promote active involvement through design partnerships and collaboration.


Project Results: By placing a premium on the involvement of end users, we are able to build in usability best practices to support ease of use and engagement.

Instructional Tryouts


Project Lead: Robin Duffy


Project Goals:  Inform and validate instructional model by infusing contextual factors into development vis-a-vis simulated or actual classroom setting.


Project Results:  By incorporating contextual factors, the users’ perspective into development it builds empathy of teacher/student experience

Market Needs Assessment


Project Lead: Kristen Braghi


Project Goals: Gather data on market and customer needs at the outset of development of a new product or revision of an existing program, in order to inform and substantiate proposed product plan and learner outcomes.   

Project Results: Provides a comprehensive base of information with regard to instructional practices, curriculum and marketplace needs, which allows product development teams to understand key drivers of a given market segment and create a roadmap for success.

Product Concept and Prototype Testing


Project Lead: Kristen Braghi

Project Goals: Obtain direct customer feedback to help prioritize and optimize product ideas at a very early stage; use customer input to uncover strengths and weaknesses in the product’s preliminary instructional design. 


Project Results: Product development teams are able to save time and cost by refining (and sometimes eliminating) ideas before development begins; enables teams to make modifications at a very early development stage, which will ultimately help drive improved student outcomes.

Pricing, Packaging, and Messaging Research


Project Lead: Kristen Braghi


Project Goals: Determines the most desired combination of product features and packaging options during the development phase, and pinpoints optimal pricing for these options in the marketplace; provides input into formation/refinement of the value proposition during the product development phase; and explores which messages resonate most with customers.


Project Results: Confirms that the value proposition and components of the product are clearly understood and resonate with customers, and optimal pricing and packaging are achieved, prior to product launch.
